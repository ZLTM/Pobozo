## Concept

A retelling of the bolivian legends, myths and folklore.

The protagonist and his party travel to a magic world pararel with the city of La Paz, Pobozo, here the player will chooze his path affecting his relationships and the world that surrounds him.

## Participation

In this project I was able to manage a multidisciplinary team while participating as a:

* Game Designer
* Programer
* Voice actor

Aside from the movement I designed and programmed a set of 3 state machines used to handle the turn based combat and the branching narrative system dialog system, also experimented a bit with an easyer way to do it using the Ork Framework.

## Gameplay

Classic RPG turn based combat with a branching narrative system.

## Installation

Windows:

Run the exe inside the .rar or play from the unity editor.
